<h2>The 1946 Eniac</h2>
</div>
<p>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was developed by <br>
John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania. <br>
According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">CNBC</a>. <br>
Based on information from <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/78">Computer History</a> at the time of its creation,<br>
the U.S. Army needed to know the calculations of <br>
ballistics tables. Eniac was the solution. It was the first to run at electronic speed without the use <br>
of mechanical parts. Up until 1955, Eniac probably completed more calculations <br>
than mankind had even done up to that point in history. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC">Britannica</a> says it used<br>
plugboards for communication. The advantage to this was that once the instructuions<br>
were computed, the Eniac completed them at electronic speed. The disadvantage<br>
of the Eniac was that it would take days to rewrite the instructions for it to complete the calculations.<br>
Despite its disadvantages, it was still the strongest calculating device ever created at that point in history.<br>
Not only did it turn the tide for computers, it turned the tide for our country in World War 2. </p>

  <h2>IBM's Personal Computer 1981</h2>
  <p>IBM released the personal computer in August of 1981. Others had been <br>
  available before it but IBM's laid a foundation for future PC's. It costed <br>
  $1,565 and had 40K of read only memory and 16K of user memory. It also came <br>
  with a built in speaker and it could run self-diagnostic checks. This information<br>
  came from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">CNBC</a>. According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_birth.html">IBM</a> it was created by Bill Lowe. When he<br>
  first introduced the plan to build one, many of the executives were skeptical about it.<br>
  Nevertheless, they told him to come back with a proposal in 2 weeks. During those 2<br>
  weeks Lowe picked out a group of 12 strategists and together they worked very long<br>
  hours to come up with an effective proposal. They had to develop plans for the hardware,<br>
  software, manufacturing setup and sales strategy. When the PC was made, it did not just <br>
  process information but, it could conect to the home tv set, play games, and process text. </p>

  <h2>Apple’s Macintosh 1984</h2>
  <p>Steve Jobs released the first Macintosh in 1984. It had the ability to <br>
  talk and at the time had an advanced drawing application as well. <br>
  The Macintosh was designed for 2 main markets, the knowledge workers<br> and the
  college workers. I found this at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">CNBC</a>. According to <a href="https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Macintosh.html">History Computer</a><br>
  it was the first commercially successful PC to feature the mouse and graphical<br>
  user interface. What's special about Apple's Macintosh is that they created all their<br>
  hardware and their own operating system unlike IBM PC's. The development of the<br>
  Macintosh began in the 1970s wit Jef Raskin. Jef Raskin was an apple employee who<br>
  wanted an easy,low-cost computer for the average person. He wanted to name the computer<br>
  after his favorite kind of apple, the Mcintosh. However, the name had to be changed due to<br>
  legal reasons. "The very first Macintosh board, which was designed by Burrell Smith, had 64<br>
  kilobytes (KB) of RAM, used the Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting<br>
  a 256×256 pixel black-and-white bitmap display."-<a href="https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Macintosh.html">History Computer</a>   </p>

  <h2>Microsoft Launches Windows 1985</h2>
  <p>Windows 1.o was releaseed in November 1985 as an operating system with a <br>
  graphical interface, and millions of people still use Windows today. I got this from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">CNBC</a>.<br>
  According to <a href="https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Macintosh.html">History Computer,</a> on November 10 1983, Microsoft Corporation met at Plaza<br>
  Hotel in New York City. They presented a graphical user interface for MS-DOS which was<br>
  designed for IBM PC and compatible computers since 1981. It was first deveolped under the name<br>
  Interface Manager, but before its debut in 1985, the marketing staff persuaded Bill Gates to name it<br>
  Windows instead. IBM and Mircosoft had been official partners since 1981 because the MS-DOS<br>
  operating system became really successful with IBM computer. Microsoft Windows 1 was first sold<br>
  for $100 in 1985 with its main competition being Apple's Macintosh. Windows 1 actually got bad reviews<br>
  with people saying it was buggy, crude, and slow. This tough beginning was made even tougher when<br>
  Microsoft was threatened with a lawsuit from Apple. Tensions with Apple would continue to rise but<br>
  eventually Microsoft would gain steady ground with the release of Windows 2.  </p>

  <h2>The World Wide Web 1989</h2>
  <p>In 1989, a British computer scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee had <br>
  thought of a “distributed information system” at CERN, which is the European <br>
  Organization for Nuclear Research, located in Geneva, Switzerland. One year <br>
  after, the fist website and server went live at CERN. I got this information from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/eight-milestones-in-the-development-of-computers-and-home-technology.html">CNBC</a>.
  According to<br>
  <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">World Wide Web Foundation</a> his idea really was not that popular at first and his boss had concerns.<br>
  The web was never really an actual CERN project. He began to work on it using an NeXT computer<br>
  which was one of Steve Jobs' earlier products. In October of 1990, Tim had written 3 fundamental<br>
  things that are at the base of today's web: HTML, URI, and HTTP. When the web began to grow, <br>
  he realized it wouldnt reach its maximum potential unless anyone could use it without having to pay<br>
  or ask permission. After some time, Tim and others at CERN agreed to make the code free for forever.<br>
  This decision was announced in April, 1993.</p>
